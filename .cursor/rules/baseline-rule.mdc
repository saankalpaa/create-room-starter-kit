- Write clear comments for any non-obvious logic.
- Use modular, testable code.
- Always use the latest package versions.
- Structure code in proper folders as above.
- Update documentation and Terraform code with every change.

## 🚫 Not Allowed
- No new libraries or tools without explicit permission.
- No restructuring of folders or architecture.
- No use of `any`, global variables, or implicit `any`.
- No code generation outside of allowed areas.
